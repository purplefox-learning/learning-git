/RemoteRoot is the unix box where remote git repo resides
/RemoteRoot/EdmiProject1.git is the git repository which is created with --bare option (by convention the name needs to end with .git)

/LocalRoot is the windows parent directory that developer used to develop all his services
/LocalRoot/EdmiProject1 is the local working directory of the remote edmiproject

=== Setup Remote Git Repository

C:\a\GitRepoTesting>mkdir RemoteRoot
C:\a\GitRepoTesting>cd RemoteRoot
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\RemoteRoot>mkdir EdmiProject1.git
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\RemoteRoot>cd EdmiProject1.git
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\RemoteRoot\EdmiProject1.git>git init --bare
# in this EdmiProject1.git directory, we should see folders like hooks,info,objects,refs and files like HEAD and description

=== Setup Local Git Repository plus the local working directory

C:\a\GitRepoTesting>mkdir LocalRoot
C:\a\GitRepoTesting>cd LocalRoot
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot>git clone ../RemoteRoot/EdmiProject1.git
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot>cd EdmiProject1
# in the newly generated EdmiProject1 directory, we should see an empty directory

=== Create the first file, commit, verify first branch exist, push to remote repository

C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>echo hello > hello.txt
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git status
# we see hello.txt is untracked
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git branch
# we see nothing output, which means no branch exists
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git add hello.txt
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git status
# hello.txt to be committed
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git commit -m "commit hello.txt"
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git branch
# master branch exists
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git status
# on master branch, nothing to commit, working tree clean
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git push
# push to the "remote" repository

=== Create the second branch, add the second file, commit, push

C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git branch develop
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git branch
# we see two branches resides locally, develop and *master. master is the current checkout branch (with a *)
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git checkout develop
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git branch
# develop is the current checkout branch
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>echo world > world.txt
# create a second file in the develop branch
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git status
# world.txt is untracked on branch develop
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git add world.txt
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git commit -m "commit world.txt"
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git status
# on develop branch, nothing to commit, working tree clean
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git push -u origin develop
# since the remo repo doesnot have this 'develop' branch, we need to create it explictly by using -u option
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git push
# push the new change to the "remote" repository

=== Switch branches

# now we have two branches master and release, on both local and remote repo
# let's see what are files in both branches of the local repo
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git ls-tree -r --name-only develop
# we see two files hello.txt and world.txt, since the working dir and the local repo has already synced
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git ls-tree -r --name-only master
# we see only one file hello.txt
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git branch
# now we verify we are still in the develop branch (*develop)
# that explain why there are two files in the local working directory
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>dir
# we see two files hello.txt and world.txt
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git checkout master
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git branch
# now we verify we are still in the master branch (*master)
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>dir
# we see only one file hello.txt this time, which is expected

=== Create the 3rd file to the branch, verify everything still work as expected
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>echo cool > cool.txt
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git add cool.txt
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git commit -m "commit cool.txt"
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git ls-tree -r --name-only develop
# we see two files hello.txt and world.txt on develop branch of the local repository
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git ls-tree -r --name-only master
# we see two files hello.txt and cool.txt on develop branch of the local repository
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git push
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>dir
# before switching the branch again, we verify the local working directory
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>git checkout develop
C:\a\GitRepoTesting\LocalRoot\EdmiProject1>dir
# after switching the branch again, we verify the local working directory
